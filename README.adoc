== Overview

When the classpath for a Gradle `JavaExec` or `Test` task is long, Windows command executions
fail due to Windows path length limitations. The error usually seen in this case is
`CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long`.

This plugin uses the capability of JDK9+ to pass the classpath to the JVM in an "argument file"
instead (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/java.htm#JSWOR-GUID-4856361B-8BFD-4964-AE84-121F5F6CF111[java
Command-Line Argument Files], thus avoiding the OS limitation.

In addition, this avoids modifying classloading or any other runtime behavior, which is not the
case with other solutions such as ones that modify the classpath in the manifest. See:

* https://github.com/viswaramamoorthy/gradle-util-plugins
* https://github.com/eshepelyuk/gradle-util-plugins
* https://github.com/virgo47/gradle-classpath-jar-plugin
* https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.ManifestClasspath

This plugin takes inspiration from those plugins, but operates in a completely different way.

== Version Compatibility

* Gradle 5.1+ (may work on earlier versions, but untested)
* Java 9+.

== Installation

Simply add:

```
plugins {
  id 'com.redock.classpathtofile' version '0.0.1'
}
```

to your build.
